config KPROFILES
	tristate "Kprofiles Kernel Module"
	default y
	help
	  This allows you to regulate in-kernel activities in a profile-oriented manner.
      it creates a sysfs node which can be used to change profiles via userspace,
	  It provides 4 profile modes, (Disabled, Battery, Balanced, Performance)

	  The former can be used to disable/enable or tune kernel activities
	  according to a profile mode. Check the README.md for more info.

      It's safe to say Y here, as the driver isn't very demanding
      and is only used when developer uses the exported API functions
      in an another driver.
